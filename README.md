```sh
poetry show -v
```

to get the virtual environment path. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to open the command prompt and run `Python: Select Interpreter` from the options. Paste the virtual environment path into the text box. Now you should be running in this virtual environment.
